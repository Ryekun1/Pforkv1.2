Vibecodr is a platform that allows anyone to tokenize a code repository on-chain. It introduces a new way to discover, fund, and coordinate around software projects by turning repositories into composable on-chain assets.

Vibecodr does not replace existing code hosting platforms. It adds an on-chain representation layer that exists alongside them.

What Vibecodr Does

Vibecodr lets users connect a wallet, submit a public repository, and create an on-chain token associated with that repository. The token acts as a public identifier and coordination primitive for the project.

The underlying code remains unchanged and continues to live on its original hosting platform.

Core Idea

Code is traditionally shared through commits and stars. Vibecodr introduces a parallel layer where repositories can be represented, tracked, and interacted with on-chain.

A repository token can represent:

A project identity

A coordination hub for contributors

A funding or signaling mechanism

A discoverability layer for emerging projects

A shared community artifact

The token is optional and does not affect how the repository functions.

How It Works

A user connects a compatible wallet.

The user submits a public repository URL.

Vibecodr validates the repository format and metadata.

A token is created on-chain and linked to the repository.

The repository becomes discoverable through Vibecodr.

The process is permissionless and does not require repository ownership.

What Vibecodr Is Not

Vibecodr does not host code.

Vibecodr does not manage contributors or permissions.

Vibecodr does not enforce licensing or legal ownership.

Vibecodr does not modify repositories in any way.

It is an on-chain representation and coordination layer only.

Why Tokenize a Repository

Tokenization enables new behaviors that are not possible with traditional developer platforms.

Examples include:

Community-driven funding and support

On-chain reputation and signaling

Transparent attention metrics

Permissionless discovery of new projects

Experimentation with incentive models

These mechanisms are additive and optional.

Architecture Overview

Vibecodr consists of:

A frontend for repository submission and exploration

Wallet-based authentication

On-chain token creation and indexing

Metadata linking between repositories and tokens

Public read access for discovery

The system is designed to remain simple and composable.

Permissionless System

Any public repository can be tokenized. Vibecodr does not curate projects or restrict usage. Serious infrastructure, experiments, prototypes, and memes all coexist under the same rules.

Attention is determined by users, not the platform.

Use Cases

Open source developers seeking community alignment

Hackathon and prototype launches

Builders experimenting with new funding models

Collectors tracking early technical ideas

Communities organizing around shared codebases
